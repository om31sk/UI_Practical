              Vegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Most are
              low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling.[18] They supply dietary fiber
              and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
              Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables
              are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of
              cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments.[19][20][21]
              Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three
              servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those who eat more than five servings
              have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart
              disease or stroke.[22] The nutritional content of vegetables varies considerably;
              some contain useful amounts of protein though generally they contain little
              fat,[23] and varying proportions of vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin K, and
              vitamin B6; provitamins; dietary minerals; and carbohydrates.

              The consumption of crunchy and hard-to-chew foods, such as raw
              vegetables, during youth, while the bones are still growing, is needed for the
              human's, and other animals', jaws' proper development, and without their
              consumption, the jaws do not grow to their full size, thus not leaving enough
              room for the teeth to grow in correctly, causing crooked and impacted
              teeth.[24][25]
